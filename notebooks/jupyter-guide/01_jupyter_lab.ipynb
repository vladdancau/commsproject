    "## 1. Introduction <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"introduction\"></a>\n",
    "Project Jupter is a non-profit, open source and community driven effort to create a web-based interactive computing environment around data science and scientific computing. Jupyter initially began as an interactive shell for Python, known as IPython. There are now over one-hundred different programming languages that have their own Jupyter kernels. In this notebook, we will introduce JupyterLab and its basic functions and features so that you can execute notebooks and run example designs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.1. JupyterLab Setup <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"jupyterlab-setup\"></a>\n",
    "Jupyter has two interactive graphical environments. One is named *Jupyter Notebook* and the more recent environment is named *JupyterLab*. When executing any of the companion notebooks, the *JupyterLab* environment must be used.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are currently using the *Jupyter Notebook* graphical environment to view this notebook, then you will need to move to *JupyterLab* to use this material.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you are viewing this notebook on an RFSoC platform, enter the following into your web browser to launch JupyterLab:\n",
    "    * `http://<board_ip_address>:9090/lab`\n",
    "    * Replace the `<board_ip_address>` with the IP address for your RFSoC development board, such as 192.168.1.120.\n",
    "* If you are viewing this notebook on a computer and you are not using JupyterLab, then please swap to JupyterLab now. We recommend using Anaconda to launch JupyterLab."
