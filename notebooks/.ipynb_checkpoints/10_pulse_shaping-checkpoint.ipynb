    "In order to reap the benefits of the raised cosine with matched filtering, we split it into two filters with identical responses. The RC shape is split into two, resulting in two (identical, or “matched”) Root Raised Cosine (RRC) filters. The RRC filter is one of the most popular matched filtering options in many communications systems. The mathematics of taking a square root in the frequency domain are fairly complicated. It is not a trivial filter to implement in the time domain, as can be seen by the impulse response definition in the equation below.\n",

    "Luckily most filter design tools come equipped with RRC implementations, due to it being such a popular choice for matched filtering. If you were using the filter design tools like those found in GNU Radio or MATLAB, you need not worry about these types of equations. Here, we will implement a simplified version, by making a small filter following the 3rd part of this equation, which should be enough to demonstrate the effectiveness of this type of filtering. We will see a division error, because we are applying our formula to a value that is undefined. We compensate for this by defining our middle filter weight as shown in the 1st part of the equation. The term $\\frac{t}{T_s}$ in our code cell is defined as $x$."

We showcased the tradeoffs of filter size and desired frequency response, as well as how the $\\alpha$ parameter for the raised cosine filter can allow us to tune some spectral properties of the pulse shaping filter without changing the number of available filter weights. The next set of notebooks will discuss amplitude modulation."
