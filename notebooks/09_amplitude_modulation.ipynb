    "This notebook will cover the modulation of a baseband signal to an Intermediate Frequency (IF) or Radio Frequency (RF) band for transmission and show how this original signal can be perfectly reconstructed at the receiver using demodulation. We will first explore a simple Amplitude Modulation and Demodulation example. These approaches will be explored step by step. The underlying mathematics will be examined and the signals plotted for visualisation in both time and frequency domains to understand each stage of the process.\n",

Demodulation is the reverse process, where information is translated back to baseband. This process is highlighted in Figure 1."

This makes for a good introduction to the world of modulation as the process and circuit design are straightforward.
